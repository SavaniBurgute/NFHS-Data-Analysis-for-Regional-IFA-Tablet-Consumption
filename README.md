NFHS Data Analysis for Regional IFA Tablet Consumption
Project Duration: July 2024 - August 2024

Project Type: Self Project

Project Overview:
This project involves the analysis of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data to examine the regional consumption patterns of Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) tablets by pregnant women, specifically focusing on those who consumed the tablets for 180 days or more. The goal was to identify patterns and regional disparities in IFA tablet consumption.

Key Features:

ETL & EDA: Extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) NFHS data, followed by extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into IFA tablet consumption across different regions.
Spatial Analysis: Conducted Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) Analysis using GeoDA to identify Hot Spots (areas with high consumption) and Cold Spots (areas with low consumption) of IFA tablet use.
Statistical Analysis: Employed Stata for advanced statistical analysis to delve deeper into the data, while SQL was used for initial data cleaning and preliminary analysis.

Highlights:

Identification of Regional Patterns: The LISA analysis revealed significant regional patterns, helping to pinpoint areas that require more attention for IFA supplementation programs.
Conclusion:
The project successfully highlighted regional disparities in IFA tablet consumption among pregnant women, providing valuable insights for public health interventions and policy formulation.
